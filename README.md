# Sand-Rush

This project was for development of a mobile application: (Timmy's Sand Rush) - an 'endless runner'-style game whereby you guide a dung beetle safely between cactuses for as long as possible without getting stuck.

The majority of code developed by me for this project can be found in the 'scene1.lua' and 'scene2.lua' files. This is nearly all hand-written code.

Aside from this, the project makes use of some external tools to manage custom fonts, graphics/sprite sheets and connections to social-media applications. 

All media assets were created with pixen (images) and Garage Band (sound) - making use of a few royalty free assets where appropriate.
