# Sand-Rush

The majority of code developed by me for this project can be found in the 'scene1.lua' and 'scene2.lua' files. This is nearly all hand-written code.

Aside from this the project makes use of some external tools to manage custom fonts, graphics/sprite sheets and connections to social-media applications. 

All media assets were created with pixen (images) and Garage Band (sound) - making use of a few royalty free assets where appropriate.
